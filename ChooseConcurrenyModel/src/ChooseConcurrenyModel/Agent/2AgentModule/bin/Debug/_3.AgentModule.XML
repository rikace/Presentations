<member name="T:ReusableAgents.ThrottlingAgnet.ThrottlingAgent`2">
<summary>
 Represents an agent that runs operations in concurrently. When the number
 of concurrent operations exceeds &apos;limit&apos;, they are queued and processed later

<summary>
 Message type used by the agent - contains queueing

<member name="P:ReusableAgents.BlockingAgent.BlockingQueueAgent`1.Count">
<summary>
 Returns the number of items in the queue (immediately)
 (excluding items that are being added by callers that have been
 blocked because the queue was full)

<member name="M:ReusableAgents.BlockingAgent.BlockingQueueAgent`1.AsyncGet(Microsoft.FSharp.Core.FSharpOption{System.Int32})">
<summary>
 Asynchronously gets item from the queue. If there are no items
 in the queue, the operation will block unitl items are added.
</summary>

<member name="M:ReusableAgents.BlockingAgent.BlockingQueueAgent`1.AsyncAdd(`0,Microsoft.FSharp.Core.FSharpOption{System.Int32})">
<summary>
 Asynchronously adds item to the queue. The operation ends when
 there is a place for the item. If the queue is full, the operation
 will block until some items are removed.

<member name="T:ReusableAgents.BlockingAgent.BlockingQueueAgent`1">
 <summary> Agent that implements an asynchronous blocking queue. </summary>
 <remarks>
   The queue has maximal length (maxLength) and if the queue is 
   full, adding to it will (asynchronously) block the caller. When
   the queue is empty, the caller will be (asynchronously) blocked
   unitl an item is available.
